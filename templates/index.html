                Smart home technology, also often referred to as home automation or domotics
                 (from the Latin "domus" meaning home), provides homeowners security, comfort,
                  convenience and energy efficiency by allowing them to control smart devices, 
                  often by a smart home app on their smartphone or other networked device. 
                  A part of the internet of things (IoT), smart home systems and devices often operate together,
                   sharing 
                consumer usage data among themselves and automating actions based on the homeowners' preferences.
